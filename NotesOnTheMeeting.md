# Annual Supervisory Committee Meeting

## McGill Policies  

### Meeting Details 

#### First Comittee Meeting

> At the first meeting the SC will evaluate the student's educational background and select courses required for the degree. For help with course selection at their first meeting, the student may wish to provide the SC  with a curriculum vitae and transcripts in addition to the research proposal.
 
#### Presentation

>  At the SC meeting, the student typically begins with a **short oral presentation of his/her work** (with slides; **based on their SC Report**), which is then followed by a **discussion with the committee members.** In some presentation, rather than waiting until the end. In rare cases, it may be felt that the written summary sufficiently describes the student's progress and the SC will proceed directly to discussion without need for oral presentation. 

#### Progress Tracking Form

> In all cases, after the discussion has concluded, the **student is asked to leave** the room while the **SC discusses the students’ performance and completes the Progress Tracking Form**.  Although SC meetings **usually follow the above format**, the precise format of the SC meeting is not fixed, in order to reflect the individual structure and needs of each student's graduate program.



###  Meeting Checklist 

_For each SC meeting the student should:_ 

- [ ] Distribute a **written SC Report** to all SC members **at least one week before** the SC meeting. This report is a summary of his/her research progress since the previous meeting as well as the work proposed for the coming year (see above for more details).

- [ ] Distribute Page 1 of the **Progress Tracking Report** with Objectives and Progress boxes completed to all SC members **at least one week before** the SC meeting.

- [ ] Print  the  Graduate  Student  Research  Progress  Tracking  Report  with  the  name,  ID  section, Objectives, and Progress completed (from the Student Forms page of this website), and bring a **hard copy** to your SC meeting. At the end of the meeting ensure that your supervisor completes the form and that you and all **SC members sign it.**

- [ ] Submit  an  **electronic  copy**  of  the  completed  Progress  Tracking  Report  form  as  well  as  the  SC Report (and any extra attachments) to the Graduate Coordinator in either Word or PDF format. Copies **must be also be retained** by the student and the supervisor.

## Supervisory Commitee (SC) Report 

> In preparation for each SC meeting, the student should complete page 1 of the **Progress Tracking form**, and prepare a written SC Report that is **a summary of his/her research progress** since the previous meeting as well as the **work proposed for the coming year**. These should be provided to the committee one week before  each  meeting.  The  **SC  Report  is  typically  10‐12 pages  of  text  (abstract,  introduction,  progress, proposed work)**  accompanied by relevant figures, tables, reference list and a proposed timeline for the coming year.  A point form version of the progress summary can be included in the PROGRESS box on the Progress Tracking Form, or attached to the form.
>
> The annual SC Reports serve a number of important purposes. In addition to allowing the SC members to evaluate the student’s progress, preliminary data, and future research plans, the SC Reports will become part of the written record of the student’s progress through the program. Importantly, preparation of the Reports  should  consist  entirely  of  the  student’s  own  written work.   Finally,  most  students  find  that preparing for their SC meeting helps them organize their thoughts and to move their research forward. At the student’s first SC meeting, it is understood that the student's report to the Committee will be more of a research proposal than a laboratory/field progress report.
